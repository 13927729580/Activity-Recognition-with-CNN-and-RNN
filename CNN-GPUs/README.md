### FlowCNN

Train a CNN on the flow map generated by FlowNet. The model is trained using Lua language with Torch7 library.

Codes were initially adapted/modified from an imagenet example from [fb.resnet.torch](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch).

TODO:
- [x] Setup CNN training with multiple GPU usage
- [x] Adapt ResNet for multiple GPUs (already done by [fb.resnet.torch](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch))
- [x] Adapt Wide ResNet for multiple GPUs (architecture of Wide ResNet is now only for CIFAR-10)
- [x] Architecture of wide ResNet for Imagenet
- [ ] Train CNN with Imagenet for better initialization (~1 week with GPUs) or wait for pre-trained model to be released
- [ ] Train a **single** CNN model on both RGB and flow maps for generating feature representations
- [ ] Prepare UCF-101 dataset for training (generating the frames......)
