## Abstract
We examine and implement several leading techniques for Activity Recognition (video classification), while proposing and investigating a novel convolution on temporally-constructed feature vectors.

#### How we tackle Activity Recognition problem?
CNN as baseline, CNN + RNN [(LRCN)](http://jeffdonahue.com/lrcn/), Temporal CNN

The above YouTube video demonstrates the top-3 predictions results of our LRCN and temporal CNN model. The text on the top is the ground truth, three texts are the predictions for each of the method, and the bar right next to the predictions are how confident the model makes predictions.

## Dataset
We are currently using [UCF101](http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php) dataset for our project. This dataset has 13320 videos from 101 action categories.

We will move onto [Sports-1M](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepvideo/) dataset to see how much our performance will be changed in the near future.

## Installation
Our work is currently implemented in Torch, and depends on the following packages: torch/torch7, torch/nn, torch/nngraph, torch/image, cudnn ...

If you are on Ubuntu, please follow the instruction here to install Torch. For a more comprehensive installation guilde, please check [Torch installation](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/torch/distro.git ~/torch --recursive
$ cd ~/torch; bash install-deps;
$ ./install.sh
$ source ~/.bashrc

```
You will also need to install some of the packages we used from LuaRocks. LuaRocks should already be installed with your Torch.
```bash
$ luarocks install torch
$ luarocks install pl
$ luarocks install trepl
$ luarocks install image
$ luarocks install nn
$ luarocks install dok
$ luarocks install gnuplot
$ luarocks install qtlua
$ luarocks install sys
$ luarocks install xlua
$ luarocks install optim
```
If you would like to use CUDA on your NVIDIA graphic card, you will need to install [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and some additional packages.
```bash
$ luarocks install cutorch
$ luarocks install cunn
```
You **need to** install the CUDNN package properly since we use the pre-trained ResNet model. First, you need to download the package from [Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (You need to register to download it.)

Then, follow this instruction:
```bash
$ tar -xzvf cudnn-7.0-linux-x64-v4.0-prod.tgz
$ cd cuda
$ sudo cp lib* /usr/local/cuda/lib64/
$ sudo cp cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include/
$ luarocks install cudnn
```
(note: There may be problems if you use CUDNN v5 since currently Torch can only detect CUDNN v4.)

## Usage
We provide three different methods to train the models for activity recognition: CNN, CNN with RNN, and Temporal CNN.

#### Inputs
Our models will take the **feature vectors** generated by the first CNN as input for training. You can generate the features using our codes under "/CNN_Spatial/". You can also download the feature vectors generated by ourselves. (please refer to the Dropbox link below.) We followed the first training/testing split from [UCF-101](http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php). If you would like to compare with our results, please use the same training and testing list, as it will affect your overall performance a lot.

* [Features for training](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ehla4szd8z8u8lw/data_UCF101_train_1.t7?dl=0)
* [Features for testing](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cma4swez0fabw47/data_UCF101_test_1.t7?dl=0)

#### CNN with RNN
We use the [RNN library](https://github.com/Element-Research/rnn) provided by Element-Research. Simply install it by:
```bash
$ luarocks install rnn
```
After you downloaded the feature vectors, please modify the code in *./RNN/data.lua* to the director where you put your feature vector files.

To start the training process, go to *./RNN* and simply execute:
```bash
$ th RNN_LSTM.lua
```
The training and testing performance will be plotted, and the results will be saved into log files. The learning rate and best testing accuracy will be reported each epoch if there is any update.

#### Temporal CNN
To start the training process, go to *./TCNN* and simply execute:
```bash
$ qlua run.lua -r 15e-5
```
For more details, please refer to the readme file in the folder *./TCNN/*.

You also need to modify the code in *./TCNN/data.lua* to the director where you put your feature vector files.

The training and testing performance will be plotted, and the results will be saved into log files. The best testing accuracy will be reported each epoch if there is any update.

## Acknowledgment
This work was initialized as a class project for deep learning class in Georgia Tech 2016 Spring. We were teamed up with Hao Yan and Casey Battaglino to work on this class project, who have been a great help and provide valuable discussions as we go long this class project.

#### This is an ongoing project. Please contact us if you have any questions.
