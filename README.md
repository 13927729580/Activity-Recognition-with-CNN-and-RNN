# Play with temporal information with LRCN and Temporal CNN for Activity Recognition #

#### Chih-Yao Ma, Min-Hung Chen (equal contribution)

## Abstract 
We examine and implement several leading techniques for Activity Recognition (video classification), while proposing and investigating a novel convolution on temporally-constructed feature vectors.

How we tackle Activity Recognition problem? 
- CNN as baseline
- CNN + RNN [(LRCN)](http://jeffdonahue.com/lrcn/)
- Temporal CNN

Demo video coming out soon!

## Installation 
Our work is currently implemented in Torch, and depends on the following packages: torch/torch7, torch/nn, torch/nngraph, torch/image, cudnn ...



## Acknowledgment 
This work was initialized as a class project for deep learning class in Georgia Tech 2016 Spring. We were teamed up with Hao Yan and Casey Battaglino to work on this class project, who have been a great help and provide valuable discussions as we go long this class project. 

#### This is an ongoing project. Please contact us if you have any questions.
